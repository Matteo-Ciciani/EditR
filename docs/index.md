# EditR

EditR is an algorithm for predicting potential editing in a guide RNA region from a single Sanger sequencing run. This allows users to estimate base editing efficiency quicker and cheaper than using deep sequencing.



It consists of the algorithm implemented in the R statistical programming language and provided as a Shiny app built to make this algorithm easy to use.

## Using the Shiny App



You can use the R Shiny App in two ways: through and instance on shinyapps.io, or installing it locally on your computer. We recommend testing it out on shinyapps.io, and then installing it locally to do a lot of analysis with.



### Installing EditR locally


1. [Install R](https://cran.r-project.org/) and [R Studio (desktop version)](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)
2. Download code from github repository, and unzip into a directory you want to work from
3. Open R Studio and run the code in dependencies.R to install the packages required
4. In R Studio, open server.R, and click the run app button
5. EditR should be started in your default web browser

## Issues / problems

If there are issues with R, R Studio, installing R packages, or Shiny, please search for the error in your search engine of choice.
